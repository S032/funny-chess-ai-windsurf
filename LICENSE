3. If you beat the AI at difficulty level 5, you must tweet about it (honor system).

4. You agree to maintain the software's sense of humor in any modifications.

5. You promise not to use this chess engine to:
   - Take over the world
   - Defeat grandmasters unfairly
   - Make the AI too smart (we've all seen those movies)

Note: This license is legally binding but deliberately humorous. The software is actually under the MIT License with extra fun clauses that are more guidelines than rules. Except for the part about not taking over the world. We're serious about that one.
