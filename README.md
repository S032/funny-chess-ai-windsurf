# 🎮 Funny Chess AI

A chess game that takes itself just seriously enough to beat you! Created with the help of Windsurf IDE's AI assistant.

## 🎯 Features

- 🎨 Minimalist geometric pieces (because who needs fancy graphics?)
- 🤖 AI opponent that thinks it's smarter than you (and might be!)
- 📊 5 difficulty levels (from "I'm learning chess" to "I am Kasparov")
- ✨ Complete chess rules (yes, even that weird en passant thing)
- 🎯 Visual move highlighting (so you know what you're doing... hopefully)
- ⏪ Undo moves (for those "I totally didn't mean to do that" moments)
- 🧵 Threaded AI (so it doesn't freeze while plotting your defeat)

## 🎮 Controls

- 🖱️ **Mouse**: Click and drag pieces (revolutionary, we know)
- **A**: Toggle AI opponent (plays as black, always judging your moves)
- **+/-**: Adjust AI difficulty (from "merciful" to "merciless")
- **Z**: Undo moves (we won't tell anyone)

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Clone this repository (the fun begins!)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/funny-chess-ai-windsurf.git
cd funny-chess-ai-windsurf
```

2. Install dependencies (it's not much, we promise)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the game (and prepare to be humbled)
```bash
python chess_game.py
```

## 🤖 AI Difficulty Levels

1. **Level 1**: "I just learned chess yesterday"
2. **Level 2**: "I know what I'm doing... sometimes"
3. **Level 3**: "I read a chess book once"
4. **Level 4**: "I'm pretty good at this"
5. **Level 5**: "Beep boop, resistance is futile"

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python (because we're civilized)
- Pygame (for all the pretty squares)
- Minimax algorithm (the AI's secret sauce)
- Windsurf IDE & Cascade AI (the real MVPs)

## 👥 Development

This project was developed with the assistance of Cascade AI in Windsurf IDE, proving that humans and AI can work together to create something both functional and slightly amusing.

## 📝 License

See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file. It's probably the most entertaining license you'll read today.

## 🤝 Contributing

Feel free to contribute! Just remember:
- The code must maintain its sense of humor
- The AI must remain slightly sassy
- Comments should be both informative and entertaining

## 🎨 Art Style

Our minimalist geometric pieces were chosen because:
1. They're easy to render
2. They're aesthetically pleasing
3. We couldn't find a good sprite sheet
4. Sometimes less is more

## 🎯 Future Plans

- Add more sass to the AI's responses
- Implement a "chaos mode" where pieces occasionally misbehave
- Add sound effects (maybe dramatic music when you're about to lose)
- Network play (so you can lose to real people too)
